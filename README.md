# Remind.me

Simple android app written in Kotlin, allowing to control 'TO DO' tasks.I wrote it to learn RecyclerView utility and it won't be developed.
The main idea was to allow user to make his own groups/categories of tasks and then assign some tasks to this groups.

There are available sorting tasks by group, date and text searching.
