## Description

Simple android app written in Kotlin, allowing to control 'TO DO' tasks. I wrote it to learn RecyclerView utility and it won't be developed. The main idea was to allow user to make his own groups/categories of tasks and then assign some tasks to this groups.

There are available sorting tasks by group, date and text searching.
